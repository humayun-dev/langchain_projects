# LangChain Projects  
### From Basics to Real-World Applications

A curated collection of **hands-on LangChain projects** designed to help learners move from **LLM fundamentals** to **real-world Generative AI systems**.

> This repository follows a **learning-by-building roadmap**, where each project builds on the previous one — starting from beginner-friendly concepts and gradually introducing advanced patterns like **memory**, **structured outputs**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## Purpose of This Repository

Many learners understand LLM concepts **theoretically** but struggle to implement **real applications**.

This repository focuses on:

- **Learning by building**
-  **Clear progression of concepts**
-  **Practical, runnable projects**
-  **Beginner → Intermediate difficulty curve**

Each project is intentionally **small, focused, and extendable**.

## Who Is This For?

This repository is ideal for:

-  **Beginners** starting with LangChain & LLMs
-  **Students** transitioning from ML/DL to Generative AI
-  **Developers** who prefer hands-on learning
-  Anyone planning to build **chatbots, RAG systems, or AI products**
